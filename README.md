# Auto brightness
## The app is replacement for system auto brightness  
- It can edit auto brightness levels  
- It adjusts brightness only when screen becomes on or the app is started
## Description
The app shows a small dialog with a brightness slider and a 'Save' button to associate current light sensor value with selected brightness  
## Why not system auto brightness?
System auto brightness runs continuously and the outside illumination changes rather frequently, so phone brightness level may change randomly causing discomfort. System luminance - brightness presets don't fit for all people, especially in dark conditions inside the room. So I decided to create the app with sets auto brightness only when phone screen is turned on with an ability to tune luminance - brightness levels       
## Preparation
1. We should disable system auto brightness
2. We need a shortcut for reliable opening the app with a gesture (even if screen is dark). There are many gesture support app with custom app start support. I would recommend 
Vivid Navigation Gestures
3. No need to say we should give the app permission for changing system settings (to change brightness level)
## Use cases
- when we realize that the phone screen is too dark or too bright we start the app by a gesture, set desired brightness level and press **Save** button to associate selected level with current illumination
